# Chicken_safety
This depository is based on Mask RCNN and the Tomato_detection repository. It is used to detect 2 classes to identify chicken health status from their posture.

This project is at it is initial stage but will be furthur improved.

•	Instance segmentation and object detection to detect the head and body of the chicken

•	The relative distance between the head and the body is calculated

•	Based on the calculation, health status is defined

•	Random images are tested and confirmed the results

However, the project is still not vere precise in defining the health status of the chicken and more data need to be used. 

Improvements:
•	Increase the number of data used 

•	Examine more attributes
